# Copy Selection With Minimal Indention README

## Features

This extension allows you to copy part of your source code in a way that allows you to paste it nicely into a chat message or a forum. It will strip away any common prefixed whitespace/characters and works with disjoined selections. Simply use instead of a normal copy selection command.
